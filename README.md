# Routing Backbone with style \o/

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/d4f/backbone-highway.svg?branch=dev)](https://travis-ci.org/d4f/backbone-highway)

----

## New Highway

Please consider using the new package [backbone-highway2](https://github.com/d4f/highway) instead which still is actively maintained.

----

```Backbone.Highway``` wraps the ```Backbone.Router``` to simplify its use and bring new functionalities

Its structure and API is inspired by routers in the Node.js frameworks: Meteor and ExpressJS.

Added functionalities compared to the ```Backbone.Router``` are:

 * Multiple controllers for a same path
 * Before and After triggers distributed using an event aggregator
 * Simple trigger cache managing
 * Aliasing between routes
 * "Secured" routes
 * Close action (similar to onbeforeunload)

## Installation

You can install the library via npm:

```
npm install backbone-highway
```

Or bower:

```
bower install backbone-highway
```

## Getting started

To get started we simply declare some routes using the ```Backbone.Highway.route()``` method and then start
the router with the ```Backbone.Highway.start()``` method.

Let's just jump right in with an example:

```javascript
// Declare a home route
Backbone.Highway.route('home', {
  // The url to which the route will respond
  path: '/',

  // Method to be executed when the given path is intercepted
  action: function () {
    // Do something fantastic \o/
  }
});

// Declare a user profile route
Backbone.Highway.route('profile', {
  path: '/users/:id',
  action: function (id) {
    // Render user profile page using id parameter
  }
});

// Wait for document ready event
$(function () {
  // Start the router
  Backbone.Highway.start();
});
```

To learn more about the routers capabilities see the full documentation here : http://d4f.github.io/backbone-highway/

## Dependencies and structure

The dependencies are:

 - Backbone >= 1.1.4
 - Underscore >= 1.4.4

Until now the library was overriding the ```Backbone.Router``` namespace. I now understand that this was a huge mistake as it was breaking the dependencies of other Backbone libraries by replacing the core API. Thus the new name ```Backbone.Highway```

## Demo / Example

A demo is available in the ```demo``` folder.

Use npm and bower to install dependencies and grunt to launch the demo server.


```
~/backbone-highway$ npm install && bower install
~/backbone-highway$ grunt serve
```
